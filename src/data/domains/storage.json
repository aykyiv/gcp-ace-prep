      "correct": "Lifecycle policies automatically transition objects between storage classes based on age. Standard for frequent access (first 30 days), Nearline for monthly access (30 days to 1 year), and Archive for long-term retention (7 years) provides optimal cost structure.",
      "incorrect": {
        "A": "Standard storage for 7 years is expensive. Logs accessed rarely should be in cheaper storage classes.",
        "C": "Coldline has retrieval costs and minimum storage duration. Using it for frequently accessed logs (first 30 days) is inefficient.",
        "D": "BigQuery is for analytics, not log archival. Cloud Storage with lifecycle policies is more cost-effective for compliance retention."

    "explanation": {
      "correct": "Multi-regional buckets store data redundantly across multiple geographic regions (e.g., US, EU, Asia), providing higher availability and durability. Regional buckets store data in a single region. Multi-regional is ideal for serving content globally.",
