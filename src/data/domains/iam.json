This simplifies permission management, makes it easier to onboard/offboard users, and follows the principle of centralized access control. The Viewer role provides read-only access across all resources.",

        "D": "While custom roles can work, the predefined Viewer role already provides appropriate read-only access and is simpler to manage."
